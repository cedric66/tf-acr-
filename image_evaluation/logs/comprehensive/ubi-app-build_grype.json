Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.16106,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","cwe":"CWE-200","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"9.7"},"package":{"name":"python-pip","version":"21.3.1-1.el9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45803","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"56ceef33fad936b8","name":"python3-pip-wheel","version":"21.3.1-1.el9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:05727758e4e13d47b4a9c85861c3658a712eb4f68a495431dbb6a9476aab52c9","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["MIT and Python and ASL 2.0 and BSD and ISC and LGPLv2 and MPLv2.0 and (ASL 2.0 or BSD)"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip-wheel:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip-wheel:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip_wheel:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip_wheel:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-1.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/python3-pip-wheel@21.3.1-1.el9?arch=noarch&distro=rhel-9.7&upstream=python-pip-21.3.1-1.el9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"python-pip","version":"21.3.1-1.el9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-14512","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-14512","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in glib.

This vulnerability affects Firefox < 129, Firefox ESR < 115.14, and Firefox ESR < 128.1.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-7531","epss":0.00067,"percentile":0.21101,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-7531","cwe":"CWE-367","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"9.7"},"package":{"name":"nss","version":"3.112.0-4.el9_4"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-7531","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d82e0bc983b61304","name":"nss-util","version":"3.112.0-4.el9_4","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:05727758e4e13d47b4a9c85861c3658a712eb4f68a495431dbb6a9476aab52c9","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["MPLv2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:nss-util:nss-util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nss-util:nss_util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nss_util:nss-util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nss_util:nss_util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:nss-util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:nss_util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nss:nss-util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nss:nss_util:3.112.0-4.el9_4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/nss-util@3.112.0-4.el9_4?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-9.7&upstream=nss-3.112.0-4.el9_4.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"nss","version":"3.112.0-4.el9_4"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-25317","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-25317","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"It was found that some Linux vendors may assign the ownership of the /var/log/cups directory to the `lp` user.

When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-59529","epss":0.00013,"percentile":0.01635,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-59529","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"9.7"},"package":{"name":"avahi","version":"0.8-23.el9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-59529","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"872dab8dac6433a7","name":"avahi-libs","version":"0.8-23.el9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:05727758e4e13d47b4a9c85861c3658a712eb4f68a495431dbb6a9476aab52c9","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["LGPLv2+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:avahi-libs:avahi-libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avahi-libs:avahi_libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avahi_libs:avahi-libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avahi_libs:avahi_libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:avahi-libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:avahi_libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avahi:avahi-libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avahi:avahi_libs:0.8-23.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/avahi-libs@0.8-23.el9?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-9.7&upstream=avahi-0.8-23.el9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"avahi","version":"0.8-23.el9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-50182","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-50182","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in urllib3.
