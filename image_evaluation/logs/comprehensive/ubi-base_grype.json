OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","epss":0.91857,"percentile":0.99673,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-14.el8_6"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-2650","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ab594b3f8d66b96e","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.1.1k-14.el8_6","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:435eb610ac5871454f34c326ffba5d7e709bf0782298c9567b505003bf5fc342","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL and ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/openssl-libs@1.1.1k-14.el8_6?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.10&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-1.1.1k-14.el8_6.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-14.el8_6"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-17049","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-17049","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"It was found that the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) delegation feature, Service for User (S4U), did not sufficiently protect the tickets it's providing from tempering.

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00049,"percentile":0.15306,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"2:1.30-11.el8_10"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c0b4dfef13e8c206","name":"tar","version":"2:1.30-11.el8_10","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:435eb610ac5871454f34c326ffba5d7e709bf0782298c9567b505003bf5fc342","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPLv3+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:tar:2\\:1.30-11.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tar:tar:2\\:1.30-11.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/tar@1.30-11.el8_10?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.10&epoch=2&upstream=tar-1.30-11.el8_10.src.rpm","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41409","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-41409","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in PCRE2, where it is susceptible to an integer overflow vulnerability triggered by a negative repeat value in the pcre2test subject line that causes infinite looping.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.16106,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","cwe":"CWE-200","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"python-pip","version":"9.0.3-24.el8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45803","versionConstraint":"none

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00072,"percentile":0.22351,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","cwe":"CWE-378","source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","cwe":"CWE-732","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"com.google.guava:guava","version":"31.0.1-jre"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5mg8-w23w-74h3","versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"32.0.0-android"}}],"artifact":{"id":"91b5f993ff08b3d1","name":"guava","version":"31.0.1-jre","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/java/guava/guava.jar","layerID":"sha256:435eb610ac5871454f34c326ffba5d7e709bf0782298c9567b505003bf5fc342","accessPath":"/usr/share/java/guava/guava.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.google.guava:guava:31.0.1-jre:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:google:guava:31.0.1-jre:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:guava:guava:31.0.1-jre:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.google.guava/guava@31.0.1-jre","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/java/guava/guava.jar","pomArtifactID":"guava","pomGroupID":"com.google.guava","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"4be917e9d119dfcb1d8f5fed5dd460f2bc2bb619"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-8277","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-8277","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in libssh's handling of key exchange (KEX) processes when a client repeatedly sends incorrect KEX guesses.

They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","epss":0.00041,"percentile":0.12251,"date":"2026-01-07"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","cwe":"CWE-364","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"239-82.el8_10.8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-4598","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"535ac5f256201c55","name":"systemd-libs","version":"239-82.el8_10.8","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:435eb610ac5871454f34c326ffba5d7e709bf0782298c9567b505003bf5fc342","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["LGPLv2+ and MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:systemd-libs:systemd-libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd-libs:systemd_libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd_libs:systemd-libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd_libs:systemd_libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd:systemd-libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd:systemd_libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:systemd-libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:systemd_libs:239-82.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/systemd-libs@239-82.el8_10.8?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.10&upstream=systemd-239-82.el8_10.8.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd","version":"239-82.el8_10.8"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-25317","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-25317","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"It was found that some Linux vendors may assign the ownership of the /var/log/cups directory to the `lp` user.

In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly.
